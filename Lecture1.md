* A typical OS consists of multiple components

	- Memory management (virtual memory) system (applications to memory)
	- file system (applications to disk)
	- device management (applications to display)
	- others ...


Monolithic vs Microkernel OS Architectures
------------------------------------------
* Monolithic kernel is highly complex and contains many components (linux)
* Microkernel has minimal functionality, perhaps only vm, scheduler, and IPC message passing (old MacOX)
