What is an Operating System?
-----------------------------
* a layer of software between many applications/diverse hardware and hardware that provides useful services to applications.

Computer System
----------------------
* Hardware
	-the central processing unit ( CPU ), the memory, and the input/output ( I/O ) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the system. 

* Operating System
* Application: Chrome, Office, games etc.
	- define the ways in which these resources are used to solve users’ computing problems.
* I/O : Mouse, Keyboard, Display etc.


O.S Functionality (OS "Kernel")
------------------------------------
* Arbitrates access to resources among multiple applications
* Provides Protection


O.S Components
---------------
* A typical OS consists of multiple components
	- A process manager with a scheduler, thread management, and atomic synchronization
	- Memory management (virtual memory) system (applications to memory)
	- file system (applications to disk)
	- device management (applications to display)
	- others ...


Monolithic vs Microkernel OS Architectures
------------------------------------------
* Monolithic kernel is highly complex and contains many components (linux)
* Microkernel has minimal functionality, perhaps only vm, scheduler, and IPC message passing (old MacOX)


Distributed OS
---------------
* watch slides
